Scarecrow in the hillock
Paddy field --
How unaware! How useful!

Husking rice,
a child squints up
to view the moon.

The she cat -
Grown thin
From love and barley.

Wrapping dumplings in
bamboo leaves, with one finger
she tidies her hair

I like to wash,
the dust of this world
In the droplets of dew.

This autumn
as reason for growing old
a cloud and a bird

Whore and monk, we sleep
under one roof together,
moon in a field of clover
