What the code does right now:

	the py-ku.py script should pull a bunch of raw json data from twitter and spit it at you. It'll rate limit after 350 tweets and then you can't
	do anything for another hour. Gotta throw the data into an external file and/or find a way to only grab a couple of tweets at a time.

	in the tests folder, there's a poem_test.py file which will make a 3 line poem from lines in a given text file.

	in the tests folder there is a syllable_test.py script that has a function that does an OK job of counting syllables by vowels. (Not my code, but using it to get ideas)
