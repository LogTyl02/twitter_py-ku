Explore the Twitter API

Consider options for using Python to access and abuse the Twitter API for my own, greedy, nasty, open-source poet porpoises.

	- Which module seems best for this project? There are a few python/twitter modules.

Decide whether to write an algorithm to determine syllable length (probably not) or feed the program sets of words with associated syllable count (more likely)
	Or find someone else who's done it, and assuming the source is open, crib that shit, and give credit to the programmer.

Write code to snag Tweets.

Write code to parse the snagged Tweets.

Write code to select appropriate words from the parsed, snagged, Tweets.

Use Oxford commas. They're good for you.

Write code to exclude dumb, non-sexy words, like articles, some prepositions.
	This is to increase the all-important muscle-to-word density factor. (Name subject to change). Though it's impossible to qualify poetry, we can leave out shitty words that add nothing to the poem.
	We want our haiku to be muscular, concise. We don't need words like 'the', 'and', 'because', etc.
	We want a list of absolutely-not's, probably-not's, and sparing (like sweets).
